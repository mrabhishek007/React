        2. render()
        3. componentDidMount()
        4. componentDidUpdate()
        5. componentWillUnMount()

4. learning how to use this.props in component
5. Passing markup from parent component to child component as 'props'
    It can be accessed using 'this.prop.children'.
6. using Stateless functional component render markup & where no event handling occurs (doesn't have react life cycle methods)

7. Lifting the component to share data between multiple component
